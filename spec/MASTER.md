# Reality Engine — Spec Master Index

## How This Document Works

This is the central index for all design specifications. Each domain area links to its detailed spec doc.

**Status indicators:**
- 🔴 Not started — needs initial interrogation
- 🟡 In progress — has content, needs deepening
- 🟢 Complete — no open questions remain
- 🔄 Needs revision — downstream decisions may have invalidated something

**Workflow:**
1. Run `/interrogate spec/domains/<area>` to deepen any spec
2. Answer questions until the agent has no more to ask
3. Agent updates the spec doc, glossary, and this index
4. Repeat for next area

## Architectural Principles

> **Only immutable, approved World Events change game state.**
> Everything else exists to propose, gate, or explain those events.

**Domain separation:**
- **World Domain**: Immutable, event-sourced, deterministic, replayable
- **Workflow Domain**: Editable, commentable, approval-gated, never directly mutates world

**Key decisions:**
- Drafts are separate entities from Events (honors World/Workflow split)
- Events are append-only and immutable
- Triggers can emit direct Events OR Drafts (configurable per trigger)
- EventTypes are named semantic schemas; Events store both type + operations
- Game itself is a GameObject (can be targeted by signal Events)

## MVP Scope

### MVP 0: Single-Game Engine
- One Game instance, one GM, N players
- No multi-tenancy or shared users
- YAML paradigm ingestion (single directory)
- In-memory or SQLite persistence
- Simple auth system (automatic trust the caller or GM approval, set in schema)
- Simple Sqlite DB
- **Goal**: Prove the core loop works

### MVP 1: Multi-Game Platform
- Shared User accounts across games
- Multiple Games per instance
- Paradigm registry
- Proper auth and permissions
- Database-backed persistence
- **Goal**: Prove the architecture scales

See [mvp-scope.md](architecture/mvp-scope.md) for full details.

## Domain Specs

Spec order (conceptual depth):
1. Events — the atomic primitive
2. GameObjects — what Events happen to
3. Actions & Drafts — how Events get proposed
4. Triggers — how Events cause more Events
5. Projections — derived read models
6. Permissions — who can do/see what
7. Paradigms — modular system definitions

## Recent Changes

### 2026-01-09: Events Spec Complete

Key decisions made:
- **EventType vs Event**: EventTypes are named semantic schemas (e.g., `DowntimePasses`). Events are instances that store both the type name AND the operations performed.
- **Two-layer model**: Semantic layer for trigger matching, Operations layer for projection updates.
- **8 operation types**: `object.create`, `object.update`, `object.archive`, `meter.delta`, `meter.set`, `ref.set`, `ref.add`, `ref.remove`
- **Meters and Refs**: Special field types declared in Kind schemas with dedicated operations.
- **Signal Events**: Events with no operations that target the Game object for global broadcasts.
- **Notes**: Moved to Workflow Domain as separate entity (not an operation type).
- **ID format**: ULID for global uniqueness + timestamp embedding.
- **Ordering**: Per-Game sequence number for strict ordering.
- **Causality**: Immediate parent + root draft tracking.

Specs needing revision due to Events decisions:
- `game-objects.md` — Kinds must support Meter and Ref field types
- `actions-drafts.md` — Actions reference EventTypes
- `triggers.md` — Match on EventType names
- `projections.md` — Consume Operations layer
- `paradigms.md` — Needs `event_types` section

### 2026-01-10: GameObjects Spec Complete

Key decisions made:
- **ULID for GameObject IDs**: System-generated on commit
- **No Kind inheritance for MVP**: Standalone Kinds; future mixins/traits
- **Single Character Kind for PC/NPC**: Optional nullable fields for PC-specific data (player ref)
- **Spec vs Status**: Spec is authored data; Status holds computed values (sync recompute on read)
- **Reserved fields on all GameObjects**: id, game_id, kind, name, description, parent, tags, owner, acl, archived, version, created_at, updated_at
- **Actions: bidirectional binding**: Actions target Kinds AND Kinds list Actions
- **Dangling refs allowed with GM alert**: No cascade/block; archived refs return data with `archived: true`
- **Kind schema format defined**: Meters, Refs, nested objects, computed fields
- **Meter overflow/underflow**: Clamp + emit system Event (MeterOverflow/MeterUnderflow) for trigger reaction
- **Expression DSL constraints**: No time refs, null returns null + GM note, archived refs skipped in traversal
- **Cross-object expressions**: Allow traversal (`bonds.*.spec.loyalty`) with null skipping
- **Object-level ACL only**: No per-field visibility; Feeds are primary player view
- **Schema drift**: Lenient (new fields null, removed fields ignored)
- **Enum fields**: Deferred to MVP 1

Specs affected by GameObject decisions:
- `events.md` — MeterOverflow/MeterUnderflow system events to be added
- `actions-drafts.md` — Bidirectional Action/Kind binding
- `triggers.md` — MeterOverflow/Underflow events; expression DSL for conditions
- `projections.md` — Sync status recomputation on read
- `paradigms.md` — Full Kind schema format; must define Game Kind
