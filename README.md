# Reality Engine

*A campaign operating system for narrative-heavy tabletop RPGs*

---

## What Is This?

Reality Engine helps GMs run long-running campaigns where **consequences matter**. It replaces your scattered notes, spreadsheets, and index cards with a structured system that tracks what happens in your campaign and figures out what happens next.

Think of it as the difference between keeping notes about your campaign and having a living record that responds to change. When the players assassinate a faction leader, Reality Engine doesn't just record that — it can trigger the faction's response, update the political landscape, and surface what the players need to know.

## Who Is This For?

**GMs who run**:
- Campaigns that last months or years
- Games with factions, politics, and intrigue
- Multiple groups in a shared world
- Games where downtime and consequences matter

**Games that work well**:
- Blades in the Dark and Forged in the Dark games
- Ars Magica (covenants, seasons, long-term play)
- Faction-heavy D&D or PF campaigns
- West Marches and persistent world games
- Any game where "what happens between sessions" matters

---

## What It's Not

Reality Engine is **not**:
- A virtual tabletop (no maps, tokens, or dice)
- A character builder or digital character sheet
- A note-taking app (though it stores information)
- A replacement for GM judgment and creativity

It's the infrastructure that makes your judgment and creativity more powerful.

## Core Concepts

### [Events](concepts/events.md)
Everything that happens in your campaign is recorded as an event. These form a complete, reviewable history.

### [Game Objects](concepts/game-objects.md)
Characters, factions, locations, clocks, and anything else that exists in your world.

### [Actions and Approval](concepts/actions-and-approval.md)
How players propose actions and how GMs approve or modify them.

### [Triggers](concepts/triggers.md)
Automatic reactions — when something happens, other things happen in response.

### [Feeds](concepts/feeds.md)
What players and GMs see, filtered by relevance and permission.
