# What is Reality Engine?

Reality Engine is a platform for running narrative-heavy tabletop RPG campaigns. Think of it as a smart journal, timeline, and world-tracker all in one.

If you've ever felt overwhelmed keeping track of faction politics, character relationships, and story arcs across months of play, Reality Engine is designed to help.

## Who is this for?

**Game Masters** who want to:
- Track what happened, when, and why—without losing details
- Run complex faction politics and downtime systems
- Let the world react automatically to player actions

**Players** who want to:
- See what's happening with their characters and stories
- Understand how different parts of the world connect
- Review the history of their campaign

## The Core Philosophy

Reality Engine is built on one simple idea: **everything that happens gets recorded, and nothing gets erased.**

When a character takes damage, that's recorded. When a faction advances their project, that's recorded. When two characters form a bond, that's recorded. These records—called Events—form the complete history of your campaign.

This means:
- You can always see how you got here
- The system can calculate things for you (like "how much progress has this faction made?")
- Changes can trigger other changes automatically (like "when downtime happens, all factions advance")

## How It Works (The Simple Version)

Imagine your campaign as a combination of three things:

1. **Things** — Characters, factions, locations, clocks, items. Everything that exists in your world.

2. **Events** — Things that happen. Damage dealt, bonds formed, factions advancing, downtime passing. Each event is a permanent record.

3. **Triggers** — Automatic reactions. "When downtime happens, advance all faction projects by 1." The system handles the bookkeeping.

When you play:
1. Something happens (a player action, the GM narrating)
2. An event gets recorded
3. Triggers check if they should react
4. More events might cascade from those reactions
5. The world state updates to reflect everything

## What Makes It Different

**It's not a virtual tabletop.** Reality Engine doesn't replace your maps, dice, or video calls. It handles the narrative bookkeeping that happens alongside play.

**It's event-sourced.** Instead of overwriting data ("HP is now 5"), it records changes ("took 3 damage"). This means you always have the full story of how things got to where they are.

**It's trigger-powered.** Complex systems like Blades in the Dark's downtime or faction turns can run automatically once you set them up. The system does the mechanical bookkeeping while you focus on the story.
