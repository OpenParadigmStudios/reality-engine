# How History Works

In Reality Engine, everything that happens gets recorded. Every wound, every alliance, every faction scheme—they all become permanent entries in your campaign's history.

This might sound like a lot of bookkeeping, but it's actually the opposite. Because the system tracks everything, you never have to remember "wait, when did that happen?" or "how did we get here?"

## What's an Event?

An event is a record of something that happened. Think of it like an entry in a campaign journal, but structured so the system can understand it.

When a character takes damage, that's an event. When downtime begins, that's an event. When a faction completes a project, that's an event.

Each event records:
- **What happened** — "Took 3 damage" or "Downtime began"
- **Who or what was affected** — The character, faction, or other entity
- **When** — Automatically timestamped
- **Why** — What triggered this event (another event? A GM decision? A player action?)

## Why Does Everything Get Recorded?

**You can trace cause and effect.** "Why is Cassandra wounded?" → "She was hurt in the warehouse fight" → "Which happened because the Lampblacks attacked" → "Which happened because tensions hit critical during downtime."

**The system can calculate things for you.** "How much total damage has Marcus taken this session?" Just count up the damage events.

**You can rewind time.** Want to see what the world looked like three sessions ago? The system can reconstruct it from the history.

## Types of Things That Happen

Events can change your world in several ways:

**Adjusting numbers.** Increase a faction's project progress. Decrease a character's hit points. Add to a clock.

**Setting values.** A character's stress is now 6. A location's danger level is now "high."

**Creating things.** A new NPC joins the story. A faction establishes a new front.

**Forming relationships.** Marcus and Elena become bonded. The Hive becomes allied with the Dimmer Sisters. Relationships can carry context too—Marcus isn't just "connected to" the Lampblacks, he's their "informant" and "founding member."

**Breaking relationships.** The alliance crumbles. A character leaves a faction.

**Removing things.** A character dies (or leaves the story). A faction disbands. These aren't deleted—they're marked as "no longer active" so the history remains intact.

**Adding context to relationships.** You can tag relationships with roles and context. A faction's "allies" might include one tagged as "grudging" and another as "blood oath." These tags help you remember *how* things are connected, not just *that* they're connected.

## Announcements: Events Without Changes

Sometimes you need to signal that something happened without directly changing anything. "Downtime begins" doesn't reduce anyone's HP or advance any projects—it just announces that downtime is happening.

These "signal events" are powerful because triggers can listen for them. The "downtime begins" signal might cause a dozen other events to fire: all factions advance their projects, all characters recover stress, all clocks tick forward.

The signal itself does nothing. The reactions do everything.

## Chain Reactions

This is where Reality Engine earns its name. Events can trigger other events, which can trigger more events, cascading through your world.

**Example: Starting Downtime**

1. The GM clicks "Begin Downtime"
2. A "Downtime Begins" event is recorded (targets the whole campaign)
3. Triggers fire:
   - Every faction with an active project advances progress by 1
   - Every PC recovers 2 stress
   - The "Streets Running Red" clock advances 1
4. One faction's progress triggers another event:
   - The Dimmer Sisters hit 8 progress
   - This triggers "Project Complete"
   - Which records that they've achieved their goal

One GM action created a cascade of changes across the entire game world. The system handles the bookkeeping; you just see the results and narrate what it means.

## Automatic Notifications

The system also emits automatic events when certain things happen:

**When numbers hit limits.** If healing would push HP above maximum, the extra gets noted. A trigger could convert that to something else (like a temporary shield), or the GM could narrate what that means.

**When things are created or removed.** The system automatically notes when new things enter the world or old things leave it.

**When relationships break.** If you remove a faction and characters were members of it, the system flags those now-broken relationships so the GM can resolve them.

These automatic events keep everyone informed and give triggers more opportunities to react.

## Stories Remember Their Events

When an event affects a story—a quest, a character arc, a faction scheme—that connection is automatically recorded. You don't have to manually link "the warehouse fight" to "Cassandra's revenge arc." If the event targets the story, the story remembers it.

This means you can always see the complete history of any narrative arc: all the events that shaped it, in order. "What happened in Elena's redemption story?" shows every event that touched that story, building a complete picture of how the narrative unfolded.

If you're recording something purely administrative (fixing a typo in a story's description, for example), you can opt out of this auto-linking. But by default, stories accumulate their own history automatically.

## The Complete History

Every event stays forever. Nothing gets overwritten, nothing gets deleted.

This means:
- You can always reconstruct how you got to the current state
- You can see the complete timeline of any character, faction, or storyline
- You can audit any decision ("when did we decide that?")

If you've ever lost track of your campaign's history, Reality Engine makes that impossible.
